This vault is primarily used to test this plugin.

To test it, create a new note from [[Plugin Test]], test each scenario and mark as done and add notes as needed.

To install the local version of the plugin, you'll need to copy these files:
- `main.js`
- `manifest.json`
- `styles.css`
Into the folder:
- `.obsidian/plugins/gtd-no-next-step`
Tags used: #next-step #waiting-for

Or, from the root of this repo, simply do:
```
npm run setup
```
Then from Obsidian go turn on community plugins, then "View > Force Reload", then got turn this plugin on.
